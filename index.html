            <p class="post-description">Artificial intelligence (AI) is a concept that refers to a machine's ability to perform a task that would've previously required human intelligence. It's been around since the 1950s, and its definition has been modified over decades of research and technological advancements. 

                Today, AI powers self-driving cars, laptops, chatbots like ChatGPT, and image generators. So what is it, and how does it work? </p>

            <p class="post-description">Eating a range of healthful fruits provides the body with nutrients and
                antioxidants that can boost overall health. Good choices include oranges, blueberries, apples, avocados,
                and bananas, but there are many more to choose from.

                Fruits are an excellent source of essential vitamins and minerals, and they are high in fiber. Fruits
                also provide a wide range of health-boosting antioxidants, including flavonoids.</p>

                So, once again: YouTube is massive — so massive it generated $50 billion in revenue over the last year, with the majority of that coming from advertising. Advertisers are spending that money because that's where the eyeballs are.</p>

            <p class="post-description">Thali is a complete meal served on a single plate. Characterized by eye-popping variety and an imposing quantity, thali easily contains 10 to 15 dishes (including rice and bread): Don’t even think of ordering thali unless you’ve brought your full appetite! Even though individual components of thali may be prepared in homes on a regular basis, the full experience is reserved in its full splendor for festivals, days of religious significance, or ceremonies and social functions. Generally, you’re more likely to find thali in a restaurant than someone’s home.
